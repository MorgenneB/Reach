<h1><strong>About Us</strong></h1>

<p>
  Looking for a party? How about finding a local ping pong tournament? What about hosting your own event? Reach allows you to do just that. Users can host their events on Reach, where it will then be advertised to other users on the app. By using a user defined radius, Reach finds events hosted on the application within that radius, relative to the user's GPS coordinates. Reach also helps find directions to events, as well as providing useful information regarding the event. This creates a fast and easy way to find something to do, especially in last minute situations.
