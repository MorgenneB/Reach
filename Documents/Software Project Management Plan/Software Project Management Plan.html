		<h3 id="internal">4.1 Internal Structure</h3>
        <p>
       The team has agreed on a democratic leadership style. If the majority votes, then the majority rules. This democratic style of leadership ensures that the majority of members needs are satisfied, which in turn will result in a more productive team. 
	To organize a large team,  members are split into seperate working categories.  <em>The categories include: Database, Front end
	Back End (for both web and app), Design, Implementation, SQA, etc. </em> <br>
		<br>
	Furthermore,  in order to ensure even and fair workload members are only able to pick 3 categories at a time. This will increase fair workload and it will also ensure members are not overwhelmed with too many roles.
		<br>
	Finally, each Subgroup will have a "group admin" or "group representative" whom will be responsible for making their group aware of and to follow the standards all members agreed to set at the beginning of the project. As group representatives, they must meet once or twice a week with updates of new constraints, timelines, and commits.

<h2 id="mpp">5. Managerial Process Plan </h2>
	<p> </p>
<h3 id="mop">5.1 Management Objectives and Priorities</h3>
	<p>The objective of this project is to develop a web and android application that allows hosts to post events, 
        and users to find those events using google maps platform. Our main priorities are securing funding in order to purchase 
	access to the google API as well as setting up create a mock up of our front end. 
	Ultimately, we plan to finish all of our deliverables by the end of term. </p>
<h3 id="mcm">5.2 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms</h3>
			<ol>
 				<li>Weekly progress meetings Tuesday’s and Thursday’s after class</li>
  				<li>Team leads for all deliverables as well as working meetings for deliverables to be organized by team leads </li>
  				<li>Communication through Discord and Facebook messenger</li>
				<li>SQA review of all aspect of project to ensure everything is correct and according to the requirements</li>
			</ol>
<h3 id="risk">5.3 Risk Management Plan</h3>
	<p>
	<strong>Risk 1</strong>: <em>Misuse of the application, for example, fake party set-ups for other purposes. </em> <br>
	<strong>Solutions:</strong>  <br>
		i. In-depth terms of service clause which alleviates legal responsibility from us<br>
	  	  ii. Report function will be implemented to circumvent this issue<br>
	 	 iii. Cautionary message to warn users when looking at locations (Similar to Pokemon Go warning about not using the app while driving)<br>
<br>
	<strong>Risk 2</strong>: <em>Server overload due to high traffic.</em><br>
	<strong>Solutions:</strong><br>
		i. Application must be portable from server to server<br>
	  	  ii. Queue system could be implemented preventing complete server overload, causing users to wait<br>
<br>
	<strong>Risk 3</strong>: <em>Malicious use of app by hosts and/or users.</em><br>
	<strong>Solutions:</strong> <br>
		i. Rating system will be implemented so users/hosts who receive excessive reports will be flagged and potentially blocked from features in the application<br>
	  	  ii. Ban systems in place in case of excessive reports, ranging from temporary bans to permanent bans<br>
	<br>
