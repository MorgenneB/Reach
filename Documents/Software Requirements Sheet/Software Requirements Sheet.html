	<h1>Reach - Software Requirements</h1>
	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
		<p>Reach is a web based application that enables its users to locate events occurring within a radius around their current location. The problem it is trying to solve is that, the ability to find events that are happening nearby within a short term is dependent on having a big network of friends in which to reach out to. Often times this network is unreliable in the short term and Reach aims to solve this problem by giving users an alternative to a reliance on their network of friends</p>
