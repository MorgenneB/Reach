	<h2 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
		<p>Reach is a web/android based application that enables its users to locate events occurring within a radius around their current location. The problem it is trying to solve is that, the ability to find events that are happening nearby within a short term is dependent on having a big network of friends in which to reach out to. Often times this network is unreliable in the short term and Reach aims to solve this problem by giving users an alternative to a reliance on their network of friends</p>
	<h3 id="1.1">1.1 Purpose</h3>
	<p>
		This document will act as a framework for Reach. This document is intended for whoever would like to gain an in depth understanding of the application as well as Reach's development team.
	</p>
	<h3 id="1.2">1.2 Scope</h3>
	<p>  
	Reach is an application where users can either locate or advertise thier events in a radius around their current location. Users consists of Host and Guests. 
	Hosts can set up a broadcast radius, fill in relevant details regarding their event, and than post it so other useres can seeit.
	Guests define the radius around them, all events are listed withn the radius, and guests can express interest in any event they choose.
	This will give the host an idea of the potential number of people attending their event.
	</p>

	<h3 id="1.3">1.3 Definitions</h3>
		<p>
		<b>Search:</b> An action to curate a list of events that are scheduled to begin or have already begun</p>
		<p><b>Post:</b> An action to introduce an event into the database to be advertised</p>
		<p><b>Host:</b> A user who has scheduled an event</p>
		<p><b>Guest:</b> A user who has not scheduled an event</p>
		<p><b>User Radius:</b> The user defined radius in kilometers around their current location in which to search or advertise
		</p>

	<h2 id="Overall Description">2.Overall Description</h2>
	<h3 id="2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
		<p>
			Reach will operate as two seperate applications.
			One will be a web based application and the other an Android based application.
			Both applications will operate using three major components.
			A front end, back end, and database.
			<h4>Front End:</h4>
			The front end is the user interface component of the application.
			It is the only part of the application users will be able to see and interact with.
			The frontend should be responsive and support multiple screen sizes and resolutions.
			It should work on any modern browser or android device depending on the application used.
			<h4>Back End:</h4>
			The back end is responsible for interacting with both the frontend and database.
			It should recieve information from both in order to carry out various functions.
			These functions include the creation, finding, and viewing of events and should update the front end and database with required information.
			<h4>Database:</h4>
			The database should hold various information regarding the application.
			This information includes user info, such as usernames and encrypted passwords.
			It should also include event information, such as address and times.
		</p>
	<h3 id="2.2">2.2 Product functions</h3>
		<p>
			Reach has three main functions which users will be able to utilize.
			These functions will be implemented with the help of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/">Google Maps Platform</a> and it's various related API's.
			<h4>Create Event:</h4>
			The first main function is the ability to create and host an event.
			When creating an event users will be prompted to input various required information.
			This information includes a name and descripttion for the event, as well as the address, times, and cost if it is a paid event.
			After the information has been filled out, a pin will be created and placed on the map at the specified address.
			<h4>Find Event:</h4>
			The next main function is the ability to find events that have been created.
			Finding events is done automatically and is only dependant on a radius specified by the user.
			Within the radius of the users location, a list of events that are upcoming or ongoing will be created.
			These events are then displayed as pins on a map, which the user can then select to view details about the event.
			<h4>View Event:</h4>
			The last main function is the ability to view the information of found events.
			Selecting a pin on the map will display all the information regarding the event.
			Further options for the user should also be displayed, such as directions to the party.

	<h3 id="2.3">2.3 User Characteristics</h3>
		<p>Users only require a basic level of technical expertise with using a website or mobile application. 
		Hosts are provided with a simple form to provide details about their events. 
		The Search interface will be intuitive to use so Guests who are seeking an event to attend at the last minute can find one quickly and without hassle. 
		Users will be provided with a tutorial the first time they use the application.</p>

	<h3 id="2.4">2.4 Constraints</h3>
		<p>Development of this application will face both time and cost constraints. 
		As there is no budget, the application's capabilities will be restricted to the monthly 
		<a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/">$200 free credit</a> 
		provided by the Google Maps API.</p>

	<h3 id="2.5">2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
		<p>It is assumed that a user's device or browser is compatible with the Google Maps API, and connected to the internet. 
		The website version should function on any operating system, and all major, up-to-date internet browsers. 
		This includes Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer.</p>
		
	<hr>	
	<h2 id="sRequirements">3. Specific Requirements</h2>
		<p>Text here </p>
	<h3 id="3.1"> 3.1 External Interfaces</h3>
		<p>
		    The following are all forms of data in which the user will either use or input using the software
		    <li>Database</li>
		    <li>Google Maps API</li>
		    <li>Username</li>
		    <li>Passwords/Salts</li>
		    <li>GPS Location (coordinates)</li>
		    <li>Timestamps</li>
		    <li>Message Strings</li>
		   
		</p>
		<h3 id="3.2"> 3.2 Database</h3>
        <p>
          <b>User Information:</b>
          Database will contain user specific information such as:
          <li>Emails</li>
          <li>Usernames</li>
          <li>Passwords/Salts</li>
          <li>Location</li>
          
          <b>Party Information:</b>
          Database will also contain information specific to each party/event such as:
          <li>Host(s)</li>
          <li>Location</li>
          <li>Date</li>
          <li>Time</li>
          <li>Rules</li>
          <li>Details and further information</li>
          <li>Custom QR code/party access password (optional)</li>
	<h3>3.3 Standards Compliance</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Log Formatting:
				<li>User:</li>
				<li>Process:</li>
				<li>Target User (if there is one):</li>
				<li>Date/Time:</li>
				<li>IP Address:</li>
			</li>
			<li>Logging Procedures:
				<p>Logs will be generated whenever a user interacts with the database. 
				The log will contain which user is interacting with the database and what it is that they’re doing. 
				This will include things like user logins, password reset requests, password resets, registering a party, sending a location to another user, requesting a location from another user, rating another user, and logging out.</p>
			</li> 
		</ul>

	<h3>3.4 Software System Attributes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Security:
				<p>Login: If the given username/email doesn’t exist within the database then an error is handed back to the client side. 
				If the username/email does exist the designated Salt for that username/email (stored in the database) is added to the given password and hashed using SHA256. 
				The hash generated will then be checked with what is stored in the database. If the two don’t match an error is returned.</p>
				<p>Encryption Algorithm: SHA256</p>
			</li>
			<li>Maintainability:
				<p>Regular patches released on a monthly basis focused on optimization and implementing fixes based on bugs noticed internally or on feedback from the user base. 
				“Hotfixes” will be released on an “as needed” basis to address any critical bugs noticed with the software.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
