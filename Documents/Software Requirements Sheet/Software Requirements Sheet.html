	<h2 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
		<p>Reach is a web based application that enables its users to locate events occurring within a radius around their current location. The problem it is trying to solve is that, the ability to find events that are happening nearby within a short term is dependent on having a big network of friends in which to reach out to. Often times this network is unreliable in the short term and Reach aims to solve this problem by giving users an alternative to a reliance on their network of friends</p>
	<h3 id="1.1">1.1 Purpose</h3>
	<p>
		This document will act as a framework for Reach. This document is intended for David Brown as well as Reach's development team.
	</p>
	<h3 id="1.2">1.2 Scope</h3>
	<p>  
	Reach is an application where users can either locate or advertise thier events in a radius around their current location. Users consists of Host and Guests. 
	Hosts can set up a broadcast radius, fill in relevant details regarding their event, and than post it so other useres can seeit.
	Guests define the radius around them, all events are listed withn the radius, and guests can express interest in any event they choose.
	This will give the host an idea of the potential number of people attending their event.
	</p>

	<h3 id="1.3">1.3 Definitions</h3>
		<p>
		<b>Search:</b> An action to curate a list of events that are scheduled to begin or have already begun</p>
		<p><b>Post:</b> An action to introduce an event into the database to be advertised</p>
		<p><b>Host:</b> A user who has scheduled an event</p>
		<p><b>Guest:</b> A user who has not scheduled an event</p>
		<p><b>User Radius:</b> The user defined radius in kilometers around their current location in which to search or advertise
		</p>

		The former going in to detail about what factors affect Reach and its requirements.

	<h2 id="Overall Description">2.Overall Description</h2>
		<p>Text here </p>
	<h3 id="2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
		<p>
			Reach will operate as two seperate applications.
			One will be a web based application 
		</p>
	<h3 id="2.2">2.2 Product functions</h3>
		<p>
			Reach has three main functions which users will be able to utilize.
			These functions will be implemented with the help of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/">Google Maps Platform</a> and it's various related API's.
			<h4>Create Event:</h4>
			The first main function is the ability to create and host an event.
			When creating an event users will be prompted to input various required information.
			This information includes a name and descripttion for the event, as well as the address, times, and cost if it is a paid event.
			After the information has been filled out, a pin will be created and placed on the map at the specified address.
			<h4>Find Event:</h4>
			The next main function is the ability to find events that have been created.
			Finding events is done automatically and is only dependant on a radius specified by the user.
			Within the radius of the users location, a list of events that are upcoming or ongoing will be created.
			These events are then displayed as pins on a map, which the user can then select to view details about the event.
			<h4>View Event:</h4>
			The last main function is the ability to view the information of found events.
			Selecting a pin on the map will display all the information regarding the event.
			Further options for the user should also be displayed, such as directions to the party.

	<h3 id="2.3">2.3 User Characteristics</h3>
		<p>Users only require a basic level of technical expertise with using a website or mobile application. 
		Hosts are provided with a simple form to provide details about their events. 
		The Search interface will be intuitive to use so Guests who are seeking an event to attend at the last minute can find one quickly and without hassle. 
		Users will be provided with a tutorial the first time they use the application.</p>

	<h3 id="2.4">2.4 Constraints</h3>
		<p>Development of this application will face both time and cost constraints. 
		As there is no budget, the application's capabilities will be restricted to the monthly 
		<a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/">$200 free credit</a> 
		provided by the Google Maps API.</p>

	<h3 id="2.5">2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
		<p>It is assumed that a user's device or browser is compatible with the Google Maps API, and connected to the internet. 
		The website version should function on any operating system, and all major, up-to-date internet browsers. 
		This includes Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer.</p>
